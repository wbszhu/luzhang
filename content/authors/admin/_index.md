  - title: Hi-Tag a simple and efficient method for identifying protein-mediated long-range chromatin interactions with low cell numbers

    summary: |
      Building on the foundations of BL-HiChIP, in 2023, our team developed Hi-Tag, a new chromatin spatial conformation capture technology tailored for low-cell-number samples. This technology simplifies the experimental process and optimizes the data processing method. It only requires 100,000 cells and allows for the identification of high-confidence chromatin loops mediated by specific histones or transcription factors without the need for additional ChIP-Seq/CUT&Tag data. The Hi-Tag technology was presented through a poster at the 10th International Conference on 3D Genomics in Hangzhou, Zhejiang, where it received appreciation from many researchers.
  - title: Enhancer-promoter interaction maps provide insights into skeletal muscle-related traits in pig genome

      In 2022, our research team developed the BL-HiChIP technique. By applying this technology in conjunction with GRID-seq and GWAS data, we successfully identified functional genetic variants associated with key agricultural traits, such as KLF6 (related to days to 100 kg), MXRA8 (related to lean meat percentage), and TAF11 (related to loin muscle depth). 
  - title: Identification and Conservation Analysis of Cis-Regulatory Elements in Pig Liver

    summary: |
      The liver is crucial in metabolism and pig production, yet the functional annotation of pig liver's noncoding regions is underexplored. We identified 102,373 cis-regulatory elements in pig liver, including enhancers, promoters, super-enhancers, and broad H3K4me3 domains, and highlighted 26 core transcription regulatory factors. Our findings showed similarities between pig, human, and cattle cis-regulatory elements. Although only ~30% of pig liver enhancers are functionally conserved in human liver tissue, ~78% of pig liver enhancer orthologues can function in other human tissues. We observed that genes associated with super-enhancers have a higher conservation rate, with ~54% of core regulatory factors being consistent across the liver of these species. This study provides a valuable resource for future gene regulatory research in pigs and enhances our understanding of cis-regulatory element functions across mammals.
